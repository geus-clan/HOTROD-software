This folder contains the project files for the internal instrumentation of PAINTREv3.
The schematic and PCB layout (KiCad format), as well as gerber files for production, are included in the folder PAINTREv3.
The software for PAINTREv3 is included in the PAINTRE_V3XR folder. Various legacy versions featuring different methods are included, though the main PAINTRE_V3XR version is the recommended release, field-tested and confirmed functional.
Due to complications with the atmega328p processors used in assembly, our field versions of PAINTRE were retrofitted with Teensy-LC microprocessors. The connections to power and i2c lines are apparent in the setup of the software. Additional questions can be emailed to clan at geus.dk.
